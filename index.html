		<p>This is a paragraph. I can alter it to say other things if I want to.</p>

		<p>This morning was nice and warm. It was sunny too and I realized that it's March already and no wonder the weather is becoming warmer. It is cool and everything but Global Warming just sucks because there were not many snow days this winter. I went out and did some grocery shopping and finally got the chance to cook. </p>

		<p>This afternoon is terrible because it started raining for a while and the sky was super grey. Weather always affecrs my mood. It sucks.</p>
