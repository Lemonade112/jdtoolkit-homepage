		<p>This is a logo I designed using Adobe Illustration. I started out drawing a circle and I twisted the circumference and that's how I created a body of the creature. I proceeded to add eyes and a board he is holding on which it says "Be weird". The logo is deaigned to encourage people to be themselves and do not conform to one standard. </p>
