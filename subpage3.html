		<p> I designed this poster also using Adobe Illustration. It was a  little bit difficult for me to constrcut the cat because I had this perfect cat figure in my head but what I constructed was less perfect than what I thought. I intitially only wanted to construct a cat but after I finished drawing the cat, I also wanted to give people a sense of where it is, therefore I placed it outdoor and under the nightsky. I added a photo of a real cat to add some sense of humor. </p>
