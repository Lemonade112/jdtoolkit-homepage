	<p> I took this video in late March at Grand Central Station. If you recall, NY was placed an order to stay home unless doing essential activities. I walked around the station and there were significantly less people. Almost all of the restaurants inside were closed.

	<p> I walked around Chinatown in late March to see what impact Coronavirus has had on this area. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, Chinatown has been struck hard. Issues such as racism and discrimination against Asian community has arised. As I was documenting around Chinatown, I notice that many people still come out to do grocery shopping. It is hard to practice social distancing with many of them in a small grocery shop. But as you can see in the video, many other sotres are closed and there aren't many people on the street.
